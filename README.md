# PIC18F-Digital-Voltmeter-Using-C

## Description

A PIC18F4321 microcontroller is used to
implement a voltmeter to measure voltage in the range 0 to 5 V and display the result in
two decimal digits: one integer part and one fractional part. Using polled I/O, write a C
language program to accomplish this.
